<p>Regex&rsquo;s some hate some love, but in the end, we all need something productive in our life. Some people hate because the mini-language can be arcane. Others love it because it adds superpowers for text processing. Learning the arcane secrets of regex can be a rough experience, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>so let do some exercises on regex like emails and IP for your everyday technical needs</p>

<h3 id="finding-mailing-data">Finding Mailing data</h3>

<p>extract email adresses from some file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-regex" data-lang="regex">([[:alnum:]_.-]+@[[:alnum:]_.-]+?\.[[:alpha:].]{2,6})</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li><p><code>[:alnum:]</code>: Alphanumeric characters: <code>[:alpha:]</code> and <code>[:digit:]</code>; in the <code>C</code> locale and ASCII character encoding, this is the same as <code>[0-9A-Za-z]</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>[ _.+]</code>: One of the characters in the brackets. in which looks for one of
these characters <code>_.+</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>?</code>: Makes quantifiers &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p><code>\.</code>: Escapes a special character for the <code>.</code></p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="check-for-ip-address">Check for IP address</h3>

<p>Look for IPv4 address in files</p>

<pre><code>([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><code>[0-9]</code>: One of the characters in the range from 0 to 9</p></li>

<li><p><code>{1,3}</code>: One to three times, &ldquo;greedy&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p><code>\.</code>: Escapes a special character for the <code>.</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Like any programming language, it just requires a bit of understanding to get the hang of it. Regex is very powerful can be used for varies of a task that is needed. so keep in mind sprinkle of regex can improve on any project you are working on the shell</p>

			<description>Graphical tree of sub-directories This oneliner command is for a graphical tree of sub-directories, this is an excellent oneliner when you&amp;rsquo;re in need to view the directories in a graphical format.

<h2 id="graphical-tree-of-sub-directories">Graphical tree of sub-directories</h2>

<p>This oneliner command is for a graphical tree of sub-directories, this is an excellent oneliner when you&rsquo;re in need to view the directories in a graphical format. The tree is a recursive directory listing command or program that produces a depth indented listing of files which not generally found on all Linux or Unix systems. The first Tree Unix utility was developed by Steve Baker which includes a verbose of feature and flag option. This one-liner is a quick fix for an alternative tree version for portable and easy use.</p>

<p>let break down how this oneliner is build by go deep with the command that is
being used.</p>

<h3 id="using-ls">using <code>ls</code></h3>

<p>using <code>ls -R</code> does recursively list subdirectories encountered. this will give
every thing in directory by level of current one</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@19472dcaa9be:/var/log# ls -R
.:
alternatives.log  apt  bootstrap.log  btmp  dpkg.log  faillog  lastlog  tallylog  wtmp

./apt:
eipp.log.xz  history.log</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="using-grep">using <code>grep</code></h3>

<p>Now with the grep command, we grep all line that end with <code>:</code>. using the <code>$</code>we
grabbing all line with <code>:</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@19472dcaa9be:/var/log# ls -R <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s1">&#39;:$&#39;</span>
.:
./apt:</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="using-sed">using <code>sed</code></h3>

<p>using the <code>sed</code> command on the final pipe <code>|</code> we will filter out the needed
directories and add |- and additional - for each level of the directories it
sitting in. with <code>sed</code> the flag <code>-e</code> will append the editing commands specified
by the command argument to the list of commands.</p>

<p>First let remove the <code>:</code> from the list directories.</p>

<pre><code>root@80edb8b49c29:/var#  ls -R | grep &quot;:$&quot; | sed -e 's/:$//'
.
./backups
./cache
./cache/apt
./cache/apt/archives
./cache/apt/archives/partial
./cache/debconf
./cache/ldconfig
./lib
./lib/apt
./lib/apt/lists
./lib/apt/mirrors
./lib/apt/mirrors/partial
./lib/apt/periodic
./lib/dpkg
./lib/dpkg/alternatives
./lib/dpkg/info
./lib/dpkg/parts
./lib/dpkg/triggers
./lib/dpkg/updates
./lib/misc
./lib/pam
./lib/systemd
./lib/systemd/deb-systemd-helper-enabled
./lib/systemd/deb-systemd-helper-enabled/timers.target.wants
./local
./log
./log/apt
./mail
./opt
./spool
./tmp
</code></pre>

<p>now let with the regex <code>s/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g</code> from sed, replace all <code>.</code> and <code>/</code>
and stop with last <code>/</code> with a <code>--</code> when in case with add additionalm base on
how many dirctory each lines has.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@80edb8b49c29:/var# ls -R <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s2">&#34;:</span>$<span class="s2">&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sed -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/:$//&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g&#39;</span>
.
--backups
--cache
----apt

--------partial
----debconf
----ldconfig
--lib
----apt
------lists
------mirrors
--------partial
------periodic
----dpkg
------alternatives

------updates
----misc
----pam
----systemd
------deb-systemd-helper-enabled
--------timers.target.wants
--local
--log
----apt
--mail
--opt
--spool
--tmp</code></pre></div>
<p>finally we use this two sed regex <code>-e 's/^/ /' -e 's/-/|/'</code> and add spacing and
<code>|</code> to the begining of the list. thier you go we have a quick tree of the
directories with <code>--</code> as levels.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@19472dcaa9be:/var# ls -R <span class="p">|</span> grep <span class="s2">&#34;:</span>$<span class="s2">&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sed -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/:$//&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/[^-][^\/]*\//--/g&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/^/ /&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/-/|/&#39;</span>

			<description>The cat is known for reading files sequentially and display its output. it maybe be a simple command line tool, but it has many uses. cat is know a known tool throght the unix history and has been port over into GNU coreutils. One important factor about cat is that since because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with any sort of data.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cat is known for reading files sequentially and display its output. it
maybe be a simple command line tool, but it has many uses. cat is know a known
tool throght the unix history and has been port over into GNU coreutils. One
important factor about cat is that since because it does not require the files to
consist of lines of text, but works with any sort of data.</p>

<p>here are of the option that this tool can do beside display information.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-b</code> (GNU: &ndash;number-nonblank), number non-blank output lines</li>
<li><code>-e</code> implies -v but also display end-of-line characters as $ (GNU only: -E the same, but without implying -v)</li>
<li><code>-n</code> (GNU: &ndash;number), number all output lines</li>
<li><code>-s</code> (GNU: &ndash;squeeze-blank), squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines</li>
<li><code>-t</code> implies -v, but also display tabs as ^I (GNU: -T the same, but without implying -v)</li>
<li><code>-u</code> use unbuffered I/O for stdout. POSIX does not specify the behavior without this option.</li>
<li><code>-v</code> (GNU: &ndash;show-nonprinting), displays nonprinting characters, except for tabs and the end of line character</li>
</ul>

<p>so let look at a few options</p>

<p>for example using the <code>cat -n</code> will show the number line of a file</p>

<pre><code>root@0868755f0791:/# cat -n etc/login.defs | head
     1	#
     2	# /etc/login.defs - Configuration control definitions for the login package.
     3	#
     4	# Three items must be defined:  MAIL_DIR, ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH.
     5	# If unspecified, some arbitrary (and possibly incorrect) value will
     6	# be assumed.  All other items are optional - if not specified then
     7	# the described action or option will be inhibited.
     8	#
     9	# Comment lines (lines beginning with &quot;#&quot;) and blank lines are ignored.
    10	#

</code></pre>

<p>now let check the end of line character with the <code>cat -e</code></p>

<pre><code>root@0868755f0791:/# cat -e etc/login.defs | head
#$
# /etc/login.defs - Configuration control definitions for the login package.$
#$
# Three items must be defined:  MAIL_DIR, ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH.$
# If unspecified, some arbitrary (and possibly incorrect) value will$
# be assumed.  All other items are optional - if not specified then$
# the described action or option will be inhibited.$
#$
# Comment lines (lines beginning with &quot;#&quot;) and blank lines are ignored.$
#$

</code></pre>

<p>with the <code>cat -T</code> command flag we can see all the tab characters</p>

<pre><code>root@0868755f0791:/# cat -T etc/bash.bashrc | tail
                   return $?
                elif [ -x /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found ]; then
^I^I   /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found -- &quot;$1&quot;
                   return $?
^I^Ielse
^I^I   printf &quot;%s: command not found\n&quot; &quot;$1&quot; &gt;&amp;2
^I^I   return 127
^I^Ifi
^I}
fi
</code></pre>

<p>now putting it all together</p>

<pre><code>root@0868755f0791:/# cat -Ten etc/bash.bashrc | tail
    62	                   return $?$
    63	                elif [ -x /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found ]; then$
    64	^I^I   /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found -- &quot;$1&quot;$
    65	                   return $?$
    66	^I^Ielse$
    67	^I^I   printf &quot;%s: command not found\n&quot; &quot;$1&quot; &gt;&amp;2$
    68	^I^I   return 127$
    69	^I^Ifi$
    70	^I}$
    71	fi$
</code></pre>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, in shell <code>echo &quot;Hello World,&quot;</code>. Hello, fellow command line users. First I want to say thank you for visiting this site. This site is for anyone who enjoys working and using the command line aka shell. Soon we are going to add tutorials, talks, news, and man others thing about the command line for any who lives or loves using the command line. Gui is a great interface, but as we know the command line offers more precision and power than any other interface known to humans as this current state. As many say or as you see on the internet &ldquo;Where there is a shell there is a way.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s explore why this the case, many have argued about GUI and having graphics interface to interact, but there is a reason why we, as a power user, developer, admin or as many walks of life return to the command line. Let discussion quickly a few reasons why, well let&rsquo;s talk why many shy always from this interface.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shell interface requires knowledge of the tools or system your using in which can discourage many.</p></li>

<li><p>People find the command line confusing as it needs a user to be explicit in their usages.</p></li>

<li><p>The command line can be very destructive in nature, which can cause a xmajor issue on users who are not familiar.</p></li>

<li><p>Not all shells interface are the same which can confuse many users.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we realize the challenges with the command line, lets weight out the benefits of using it and why so many returns to it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, the command line offers in almost all cases, the command line is much faster and easier to use for expirence and pwoer users</p></li>

<li><p>for most complex tasks, the command line or shell can be scripted to automate things</p></li>
</ul>
